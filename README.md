- then the user can submit what they have filled out
- A POST request is sendt to the server with the data the user has filled in
- once the request is received by the server, the server then processes the info and stores it in the json file

## Task Two

- Once the user enters the website, the website retrieves information from its database
- This information is then displayed for the user
- the user, to see the projects, will then click the option for projects in the navbar or on the front page(some projects might be displayed ina thought bubble on the front page)
